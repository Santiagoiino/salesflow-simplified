# SalesFlow Architecture

## System Overview
SalesFlow is built on a serverless architecture using n8n as the workflow automation platform. The system integrates multiple services to provide a seamless sales management experience through email monitoring and automated processing.

## Core Components

### 1. Email Integration (Gmail)

- Processes email content automatically
- Extracts relevant sales information
- Supports multiple email formats

### 2. Database Layer (Airtable)
- Stores sales information
- Manages customer data
- Handles CRUD operations
- Provides real-time updates
- Supports custom views and reports

### 3. AI Processing Layer
- Classifies sales channels
- Interprets email content
- Extracts relevant data
- Provides intelligent categorization

### 4. Notification System (Telegram)
- Sends real-time sales alerts
- Provides formatted notifications
- Supports rich text formatting
- Enables instant communication

## Data Flow
1. New email received in Gmail
2. System processes email content
